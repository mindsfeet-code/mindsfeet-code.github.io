  A decision has been made to transition Data Operations services to X (X) and discontinue the Managed Services component currently provided by Y under the VCD agreement. While the original termination date was scheduled for July 21, 2025, this has now been extended to September 30, 2025, as of last evening. We are actively working to ensure all necessary access is granted to X personnel, allowing ample time for them to assume primary support responsibilities while Y remains engaged during the transition period.
