  <p>Moving our batch ETL workloads from always‑on clusters to a serverless, event‑driven architecture represents a strategic lever for both cost optimization and enhanced customer value. By adopting pay‑per‑use compute—triggered only when data arrives—we eliminate the fixed expense of running Spark or Hadoop clusters around the clock. This shift not only reduces our infrastructure spend by an estimated 30–50%, but also removes the operational overhead of capacity planning and cluster management.

On the customer side, event‑driven pipelines deliver data to analytics and dashboards in near real time rather than in overnight batches. With managed retry and versioning features baked into serverless services, our data products will be more reliable and consistent. Faster, more dependable insights empower decision‑makers and drive higher engagement with our analytics offerings.

To get started, we’ll pilot a representative pipeline using a serverless function triggered by object‑storage events. We’ll measure cost per gigabyte processed, end‑to‑end latency, and error rates against our existing cluster‑based implementation. Once we validate the expected savings and performance gains, we’ll iteratively migrate additional workloads until the majority of our ETL processes run on the new platform.

By transforming fixed infrastructure costs into elastic, usage‑based spending and delivering fresher, more trustworthy data, this initiative aligns directly with our goals of operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. I recommend prioritizing this pilot in our next quarter roadmap.</p>
