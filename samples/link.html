    <a href="https://gradientflow.substack.com/p/data-engineering-for-machine-users">Data Engineering in 2026: What Changes?</a>
    <p>In the 2026 agent-native era, data engineering focuses on AI agents as the primary "machine users," prioritizing automation, reliability, and safety amid agents driving over 80% of new database creations and surging prompt volumes. Key shifts include modular PARK (PyTorch, AI Models, Ray, and Kubernetes) stacks, multimodal lakehouses, context stores for business logic, confidence-gated execution for safety, and ephemeral databases.</p>

    <p>GraphRAG enhances conventional RAG by building a hierarchical knowledge graph from raw documents, enabling both granular local retrieval and global corpus-level reasoning for LLMs. GraphRAG synthesizes high-level insights and reduces hallucinations by using token-overlapping chunking, entity resolution, weighted relationships, and recursive community detection. The dual Local/Global retrieval modes resolve prior trade-offs between precision and corpus-wide understanding at the cost of pre-computation.</p>

    <p>Lightweight query classification slashes RAG costs and latency while boosting precision for complex enterprise queries.</p>

    <a href="https://www.philschmid.de/mcp-cli">Introducing MCP CLI: A way to call MCP Servers Efficiently</a>
    <p>2026-01-09</p>
    <p>MCP-CLI is a lightweight, open-source command-line tool that enables efficient, dynamic interaction with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. By supporting just-in-time tool discovery and execution instead of statically loading all tool definitions, it drastically reduces token consumption (up to 99% savings), making it ideal for AI coding agents like Gemini CLI or Claude Code.</p>

    <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/learn/rag-access-control/">RAG with Access Control</a>
    <p>2026-01-08</p>
    <p>Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC) models data access as a graph of relationships between users and resources, providing flexibility for dynamic and context-rich applications. SpiceDB, an open-source Zanzibar-based ReBAC implementation, can be integrated with vector databases like Pinecone to secure RAG pipelines with fine-grained policies. OpenAI uses SpiceDB to enforce access policies over 37 billion documents across 5 million ChatGPT Connector users, effectively preventing information leakage when serving domain-specific knowledge.</p>

    <a href="https://www.dataengineeringweekly.com/p/a-critique-of-iceberg-rest-catalog">A Critique of Iceberg REST Catalog: A Classic Case of Why Semantic Spec Fails</a>
    <p>2026-01-09</p>
    <p>Apache Iceberg's REST Catalog specification ensures semantic interoperability, enabling diverse engines such as Trino, Spark, and Flink to interact seamlessly via a universal API. However, the standard omits operational guarantees (no defined latency, throughput, or synchronization SLAs), leading to unpredictable performance, high retry amplification, and systemic instability as table and catalog counts scale. This lack of operational constraints shifts the burden to clients and operators, making systems fragile and hard to maintain, highlighting the need for explicit behavioral contracts and conformance testing to ensure reliability at enterprise scale.</p>

    <p>2026-01-09</p>
    <p>Percona has donated OpenEverest, a unified Kubernetes-native database management tool that supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB, to the CNCF under Apache 2.0 open source licensing. OpenEverest enables vendor-agnostic provisioning, high availability, disaster recovery, and autoscaling through standardized CRDs and RESTful APIs, simplifying database ops without requiring database-specific expertise.</p>
