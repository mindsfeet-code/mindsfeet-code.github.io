    <p>In the 2026 agent-native era, data engineering focuses on AI agents as the primary "machine users," prioritizing automation, reliability, and safety amid agents driving over 80% of new database creations and surging prompt volumes. Key shifts include modular PARK (PyTorch, AI Models, Ray, and Kubernetes) stacks, multimodal lakehouses, context stores for business logic, confidence-gated execution for safety, and ephemeral databases.</p>

    <p>GraphRAG enhances conventional RAG by building a hierarchical knowledge graph from raw documents, enabling both granular local retrieval and global corpus-level reasoning for LLMs. GraphRAG synthesizes high-level insights and reduces hallucinations by using token-overlapping chunking, entity resolution, weighted relationships, and recursive community detection. The dual Local/Global retrieval modes resolve prior trade-offs between precision and corpus-wide understanding at the cost of pre-computation.</p>
